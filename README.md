Roku Streaming Client and Server

# Project State
## Goals
* Easy to configure minimal backend ( Goal Met )
* Video and Music Playback Support ( Only Video functional at this time )
* Resume Video Playback from Last State ( Incomplete )
* Rating System ( Incomplete )
* Server Side User Sessions for State Information and Rating Information ( Incomplete )
* Search Feature ( Incomplete )
* Music Visualizer ( Wishlist )
* Syncronous Playback on Multiple Devices ( Wishlist )

## Current State
Focusing on getting functionality down, ratings are at the bottom of the list but I kind of want them.

Wishlist items are cool, but likely problematic and difficult. Dont' expect them soon.
